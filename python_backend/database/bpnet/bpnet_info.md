## Body Pose Net Model

Human pose estimation is a popular computer vision task of estimating key points on a person’s body such as eyes, arms, and legs. This can help classify a person’s actions, such as standing, sitting, walking, lying down, jumping, and so on.

Understanding the context of what a person might be doing in a scene has broad application across a wide range of industries. In a retail setting, this information can be used to understand customer behavior, enhance security, and provide richer analytics. In healthcare, this can be used to monitor patients and alert medical personnel if the patient needs immediate attention. On a factory floor, human pose can be used to identify if proper safety protocols are being followed.

In general, this is a reliable approach in applications that require understanding of human activity and commonly used as one of the key components in more complex tasks such as gesture, tracking, anomaly detection, and so on.
